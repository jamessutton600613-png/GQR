# Gated Quantum Resonator (GQR) Programme

The **Gated Quantum Resonator (GQR)** programme is a **geometry-first framework** for molecular and quantum dynamics.

Rather than enumerating exhaustive particle trajectories, GQR infers **admissible dynamical structure** from geometry, gating, and constraint. Dynamics are treated as arising from restricted configuration spaces shaped by boundary conditions, coupling topology, and multi-centre geometry.

## Scope and Compatibility

> **All physical claims remain within standard quantum chemistry; the framework introduces no new observables, operators, or postulates.**

The GQR framework:

- Does **not** invoke long-range quantum coherence, macroscopic superposition, or sustained entanglement in biological systems  
- Is **fully compatible** with standard decoherence theory  
- Concerns **ultrafast, geometry-gated quantum transitions** whose outcomes are fixed prior to environmental decoherence  
- In some applications, employs **effective Hamiltonians of higher or unusual dimensionality**, arising from geometric constraint, multi-centre coupling, or coarse-grained representations  

These Hamiltonians reflect a **modelling and representation choice**, not new quantum postulates or modifications of quantum mechanics, and are standard practice when reducing or embedding geometry-conditioned subspaces.

## Encouraging Results (Provisional)

Encouraging results have been obtained from applying the GQR framework to **high-resolution crystal structures** across several well-characterised systems, including:

- The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II  
- Enzymes containing Fe–S clusters  
- YBCO (YBa₂Cu₃O₇₋ₓ) superconducting materials  

In each case, analysis focuses on **experimentally resolved geometries** and their role in constraining *quantum-allowed transitions* during bond formation, electron transfer, or coupled multi-centre dynamics.

These results are derived from **established structural data** and **standard quantum-chemical formalisms**, with GQR providing a **geometry-conditioned representation** of the accessible transition space. No assumptions of long-lived coherence or nonstandard quantum effects are required.

The reported findings should be regarded as **provisional** and are currently undergoing **peer review**. Further validation, independent replication, and critical assessment will determine their scope and limitations.

## How to Read the GQR Programme

This is a **live research programme** under active development. Readers are **not expected to read everything**.

- 🧠 **Conceptual intuition and analogies** provide programme-level framing  
- ⚙️ **Methods** describe geometry-gated molecular and quantum dynamics  
- 🧩 **Kernel documents** outline the geometry-first, model-agnostic architecture  

Readers concerned only with validation of a specific result should consult the relevant manuscript directly.

## Field Convergence and Context (Living List)

### Purpose

Research programmes mature not only through individual articles, but through **contextual accumulation**: the comparison of independently obtained results that reveal consistent structural patterns across domains.

This section documents **independent convergence**, even where the original works:

- do not reference GQR,  
- are framed conservatively or instrumentally,  
- or fall outside the scope of any single manuscript.  

Inclusion indicates **conceptual relevance**, not endorsement, reinterpretation, or claimed equivalence with GQR. Entries are listed chronologically and the list is living.

**Chiral fermionic transport gated by quantum geometry (2026)**  

Dixit *et al.* report a chiral fermionic valve in which directional electronic transport arises from quantum-geometric properties of the electronic structure rather than from magnetic fields, dissipation, or classical asymmetry. The device exploits Berry curvature and band-geometry effects to achieve non-reciprocal conduction in a solid-state system.

**Relevance to GQR:**  
This work demonstrates that **quantum geometry can gate and bias fermionic transport outcomes** without invoking long-lived coherence or nonstandard quantum effects. The emergence of directionality from geometric structure alone closely parallels the GQR principle that geometry and constraint can pre-select admissible dynamical pathways and outcomes, here realised in a condensed-matter setting.

## Independent Field Movements Relevant to GQR (Chronological)

### Constraint-selected multidimensional nonlinear wave structures (2026)

Dieli *et al.* report the first experimental observation of **lump solitons**—long-predicted multidimensional solutions of integrable nonlinear equations—stabilised by global constraints rather than trajectory tracking.

**Relevance to GQR:**  
Demonstrates how geometry and integrability conditions can pre-select stable outcomes in complex systems, independent of microscopic noise or detailed trajectory control.

Rocha *et al.* demonstrate that complex multi-plane optical transformations can be physically learned and stabilised *in situ*, without offline inverse Hamiltonian design, via hardware-embedded optimisation.

Supports geometry-first, boundary-condition-driven outcome selection in real, noisy systems, illustrating physical self-configuration without reliance on long-lived coherence.

### Cryogenic self-healing via internal field and energy-landscape minimisation (2026)

Ding *et al.* report autonomous structural and optical self-healing in an organic crystal down to liquid-nitrogen temperatures, driven by dipolar and energy-landscape effects rather than thermal diffusion.

### Geometry- and constraint-conditioned electronic phases in moiré systems (2025)

Kumar, Lewandowski & Changlani analyse the origin and stability of **generalised Wigner crystallinity** in triangular moiré superlattices, showing how interaction geometry and frustration govern emergent phases.

**Relevance to GQR:**  
Demonstrates that geometric and coupling structure alone can delimit accessible dynamical outcomes in strongly correlated quantum systems, with phase behaviour conditioned by constraint rather than fine-tuned trajectories.
