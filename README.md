### Quantum Resonators in Biology

#### Structural delay in drug-discovery abstraction

The GQR programme is motivated in part by the observation that certain classes of geometry-gated and ultrafast dynamical mechanisms were slow to consolidate into mainstream modelling and drug-discovery practice. This was not due to coordinated suppression, but to structural factors: influential decoherence arguments encouraged narrow interpretations of biologically relevant quantum effects, while institutional and industrial incentives favoured approaches that scaled immediately within established pipelines. As a result, reaction-path control and geometry-first transition mechanisms remained fragmented across disciplines. In hindsight, this likely delayed their systematic exploitation by approximately 10–20 years.

### Context

Several components of the GQR framework originated from work that did not conform to the scope expectations of conventional specialist physics journals. In multiple cases, submissions were assessed as outside journal remit rather than incorrect in substance. This experience reflects a broader structural limitation of siloed publication models when evaluating geometry-first, cross-disciplinary approaches, and motivates the use of open, scope-flexible review venues for the present programme.

This programme therefore proceeds on the assumption that scientific validity and journal scope are distinct questions, and treats open evaluation as a feature rather than a compromise.

### A note for interdisciplinary readers

Readers familiar with debates around “quantum biology” may reasonably wonder whether this work invokes controversial claims about long-range coherence, macroscopic superposition, or nonstandard physics. It does not.

All physical assumptions in the GQR framework remain within standard quantum chemistry and open quantum systems theory. The framework introduces no new physical postulates, observables, or departures from established quantum mechanics. It does not rely on sustained coherence in warm biological environments, nor on quantum effects persisting beyond accepted decoherence timescales.

Instead, GQR concerns **ultrafast, local, geometry-gated quantum transitions** whose outcomes are fixed on timescales shorter than environmental decoherence. In this sense, quantum effects enter as transient selection mechanisms rather than as long-lived states.

Where higher-dimensional or unconventional Hamiltonian representations appear, these reflect modelling choices arising from geometric constraint, multi-centre coupling, or coarse-grained subspace projection, all of which are standard practices in quantum chemistry and condensed-matter modelling.

Readers may therefore interpret the framework as a geometry-first reorganisation of familiar quantum principles, rather than as a proposal of exotic or speculative physics.

## Encouraging Results (Provisional)

Encouraging results have been obtained from applying the GQR framework to **high-resolution crystal structures** across several well-characterised systems, including:

- The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II  
- Enzymes containing Fe–S clusters  
- YBCO (YBa₂Cu₃O₇₋ₓ) superconducting materials  
- Dirac quantum fluids (e.g. graphene), where ordering-governed accessibility enables modelling of extreme transport anomalies  

In each case, analysis focuses on **experimentally resolved geometries** (or, in the case of Dirac fluids, experimentally characterised connectivity and mode structure) and their role in constraining *quantum-allowed transitions* during bond formation, electron transfer, or coupled multi-centre dynamics.

These results are derived from **established structural data and experimental characterisation** together with **standard quantum-chemical or transport formalisms**, with GQR providing a **geometry- or ordering-conditioned representation** of the accessible transition space. No assumptions of long-lived coherence or nonstandard quantum effects are required.

The reported findings should be regarded as **provisional** and are currently undergoing **peer review**. Further validation, independent replication, and critical assessment will determine their scope and limitations.

## How to Read the GQR Programme

This is a **live research programme** under active development. Readers are **not expected to read everything**.

- 🧠 **Conceptual intuition and analogies** provide programme-level framing  
- ⚙️ **Methods** describe geometry-gated molecular and quantum dynamics  
- 🧩 **Kernel documents** outline the geometry-first, model-agnostic architecture  

Readers concerned only with validation of a specific result should consult the relevant manuscript directly.
