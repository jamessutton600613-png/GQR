### Quantum Resonators in Biology

#### Structural delay in drug-discovery abstraction

The GQR programme is motivated in part by the observation that certain classes of geometry-gated and ultrafast dynamical mechanisms were slow to consolidate into mainstream modelling and drug-discovery practice. This was not due to coordinated suppression, but to structural factors: influential decoherence arguments encouraged narrow interpretations of biologically relevant quantum effects, while institutional and industrial incentives favoured approaches that scaled immediately within established pipelines. As a result, reaction-path control and geometry-first transition mechanisms remained fragmented across disciplines. In hindsight, this likely delayed their systematic exploitation by approximately 10–20 years.

### Context

Several components of the GQR framework originated from work that did not conform to the scope expectations of conventional specialist physics journals. In multiple cases, submissions were assessed as outside journal remit rather than incorrect in substance. This experience reflects a broader structural limitation of siloed publication models when evaluating geometry-first, cross-disciplinary approaches, and motivates the use of open, scope-flexible review venues for the present programme.

This programme therefore proceeds on the assumption that scientific validity and journal scope are distinct questions, and treats open evaluation as a feature rather than a compromise.

### A note for interdisciplinary readers

Readers familiar with debates around “quantum biology” may reasonably wonder whether this work invokes controversial claims about long-range coherence, macroscopic superposition, or nonstandard physics. It does not.

All physical assumptions in the GQR framework remain within standard quantum chemistry and open quantum systems theory. The framework introduces no new physical postulates, observables, or departures from established quantum mechanics. It does not rely on sustained coherence in warm biological environments, nor on quantum effects persisting beyond accepted decoherence timescales.

Instead, GQR concerns **ultrafast, local, geometry-gated quantum transitions** whose outcomes are fixed on timescales shorter than environmental decoherence. In this sense, quantum effects enter as transient selection mechanisms rather than as long-lived states.

Where higher-dimensional or unconventional Hamiltonian representations appear, these reflect modelling choices arising from geometric constraint, multi-centre coupling, or coarse-grained subspace projection, all of which are standard practices in quantum chemistry and condensed-matter modelling.

Readers may therefore interpret the framework as a geometry-first reorganisation of familiar quantum principles, rather than as a proposal of exotic or speculative physics.

## Encouraging Results (Provisional)

Encouraging results have been obtained from applying the GQR framework to **high-resolution crystal structures** across several well-characterised systems, including:

- The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II  
- Enzymes containing Fe–S clusters  
- YBCO (YBa₂Cu₃O₇₋ₓ) superconducting materials  

In each case, analysis focuses on **experimentally resolved geometries** and their role in constraining *quantum-allowed transitions* during bond formation, electron transfer, or coupled multi-centre dynamics.

These results are derived from **established structural data** and **standard quantum-chemical formalisms**, with GQR providing a **geometry-conditioned representation** of the accessible transition space. No assumptions of long-lived coherence or nonstandard quantum effects are required.

The reported findings should be regarded as **provisional** and are currently undergoing **peer review**. Further validation, independent replication, and critical assessment will determine their scope and limitations.

## Field Convergence and Context (Living List)

### Purpose

Research programmes mature not only through individual articles, but through **contextual accumulation**: the comparison of independently obtained results that reveal consistent structural patterns across domains.

This section documents **independent convergence**, even where the original works:

- do not reference GQR,  
- are framed conservatively or instrumentally,  
- or fall outside the scope of any single manuscript.  

Inclusion indicates **conceptual relevance**, not endorsement, reinterpretation, or claimed equivalence with GQR. Entries are listed chronologically and the list is living.


### Entanglement as a transient accelerator of outcome selection in quantum dynamics (2025)

Zhao, Zhou & Childs demonstrate that quantum entanglement can *accelerate* quantum simulation algorithms, contrary to the long-standing view that entanglement is primarily an obstacle. By deriving tighter error bounds for product-formula simulations and introducing adaptive protocols that exploit entanglement entropy, they show that highly entangled states can improve algorithmic performance on quantum hardware without requiring long-lived or protected coherence.

**Relevance to GQR:**  
This work independently supports the GQR/QGE position that entanglement need not be treated as a fragile resource that must persist to be operationally relevant. Instead, entanglement can function as a **transient structural feature** that shapes admissible dynamical pathways and fixes outcomes *before* decoherence dominates. In this sense, entanglement appears as a consequence of constrained geometry and coupling topology rather than as a sustained state requiring protection—closely paralleling the GQR interpretation of apparent entanglement in systems such as the oxygen-evolving complex.

### Chiral fermionic transport gated by quantum geometry (2026) ###

Dixit *et al.* report a chiral fermionic valve in which directional electronic transport arises from quantum-geometric properties of the electronic structure rather than from magnetic fields, dissipation, or classical asymmetry. The device exploits Berry curvature and band-geometry effects to achieve non-reciprocal conduction in a solid-state system.

**Relevance to GQR:**  
This work demonstrates that **quantum geometry can gate and bias fermionic transport outcomes** without invoking long-lived coherence or nonstandard quantum effects. The emergence of directionality from geometric structure alone closely parallels the GQR principle that geometry and constraint can pre-select admissible dynamical pathways and outcomes, here realised in a condensed-matter setting.

### Constraint-selected multidimensional nonlinear wave structures (2026)

Demonstrates how geometry and integrability conditions can pre-select stable outcomes in complex systems, independent of microscopic noise or detailed trajectory control.

### Cryogenic self-healing via internal field and energy-landscape minimisation (2026)

Ding *et al.* report autonomous structural and optical self-healing in an organic crystal down to liquid-nitrogen temperatures, driven by dipolar and energy-landscape effects rather than thermal diffusion.

**Relevance to GQR:**  
Undermines kinetics-first assumptions and supports constraint-dominated, non-Arrhenius pathways consistent with geometry-gated transition selection.

### Geometry- and constraint-conditioned electronic phases in moiré systems (2025)

Kumar, Lewandowski & Changlani analyse the origin and stability of **generalised Wigner crystallinity** in triangular moiré superlattices, showing how interaction geometry and frustration govern emergent phases.

**Relevance to GQR:**  
Demonstrates that geometric and coupling structure alone can delimit accessible dynamical outcomes in strongly correlated quantum systems, with phase behaviour conditioned by constraint rather than fine-tuned trajectories.

### Constraint-selected self-assembly of mutually repelling particles under confinement (2025)

de Lima *et al.* show that systems of mutually repelling particles confined in two-dimensional geometries self-organise into stable clusters, shells, and frustrated microstructures despite purely repulsive interactions.

**Relevance to GQR:**  
Demonstrates that geometric confinement and global constraints can pre-select stable configurations in complex systems without detailed trajectory control, paralleling GQR’s constraint-biased outcome selection principle.
