## GQR News — Topological Leaky Transport as Geometry-Gated Readout (Jan 2026)

**Recent experimental work in 1 (published 12 January 2026)** reports an on-chip *topological leaky-wave antenna* based on valley photonic crystals, demonstrating that **topologically protected transport and controlled radiation leakage can coexist within a single geometry-defined structure** [1].

Rather than treating radiation as an undesirable loss, the authors intentionally exploit **conical leakage from topological edge states** to achieve wide-angle beam scanning, frequency-division multiplexing, and bidirectional on-chip ↔ free-space coupling at terahertz frequencies. Crucially, emission directionality and robustness are governed primarily by **lattice geometry and boundary topology**, rather than fine-tuned material parameters or active electronic control.

This result is directly relevant to the **Gated Quantum Resonator (GQR)** programme, particularly:

- **GQR-XIV** — *Dynamic Proof of Geometry-Gated Transport*:  
  The reported device provides a photonic analogue of **geometry-gated transport**, where information flow is constrained by curvature and boundary conditions prior to energetic optimisation.

- **GQR-XV / GQR-XVI** — *Leakage as Readout, Not Loss*:  
  The use of structured topological leakage as a functional output channel aligns with the GQR view that **dissipation and emission can act as deterministic readout surfaces** rather than failure modes.

- **GQR-XXVII** — *Directional and Bidirectional Interfaces*:  
  The demonstrated time-reversal-symmetric bidirectional coupling (simultaneous transmission and reception without reconfiguration) supports the GQR position that **robust interfaces between protected internal dynamics and classical environments do not require long-lived macroscopic coherence**.

Overall, this work constitutes an **experimental photonic validation by analogy** of key GQR principles: geometry-first control, gated release of protected dynamics, and the reinterpretation of leakage as structured signal rather than noise.

## Secondly....the wormhole bridge side of GQR:

Since initial deposition, several independent works have appeared that clarify the
interpretation of Einstein–Rosen (ER) bridges as effective, non-classical structures
that do not correspond to traversable spacetime wormholes.

In particular, Gaztañaga et al. (Class. Quantum Grav. 43 (2026) 015023) provide a
reformulation of ER bridges as mathematical and geometric identifications in
Hilbert space, associated with discrete symmetries, superselection sectors, and
unitarity restoration in quantum field theory in curved spacetime. In this
framework, connectivity does not imply transport, and no exotic matter or
energy-condition violations are required.

These developments are conceptually compatible with the Gated Quantum Resonator
(GQR) framework, in which non-thermal transport arises only under resonance-gated
curvature conditions, and effective “bridge-like” behaviour appears in coherence
space rather than as a spacetime shortcut.  See SUTTON, J. (2026). GQR–XIV: Dynamic

**2026-01-13**  
Two new manuscripts within the GQR / Quantum Geometry Engine (QGE) programme have been submitted for peer review:

- *The Shield Law: Curvature–Coherence Invariance in a Vibronically-Gated Five-Centre Quantum System* (GQR) — submitted to **F1000Research** for open-access peer review.  
  The decision to submit this work to F1000Research reflects the cross-disciplinary nature of the framework. The geometry-first approach does not align cleanly with the established scope boundaries of many specialist physics journals, which are necessarily selective and risk-aware in their remit. Open peer review was therefore chosen to enable transparent evaluation without constraining the work to a single disciplinary silo.

In addition, the standalone physics manuscript occupying the honorary **GQR18** slot,

- *Transient Directed Transport in a Minimal Time-Gated Quantum System*, is also submitted to a Physics journal for peer review,

is included here as a related contribution. This work is not formally part of the GQR series and represents a self-contained physics study that informed later geometry-first developments. It is referenced for conceptual continuity only and is intended to be evaluated independently, without reliance on the broader GQR programme. A dedicated physics repository is planned for such standalone works.

More broadly, there is no evidence of any conspiracy or intentional suppression of drug discovery. What likely occurred instead was a structural delay. Following widely cited decoherence arguments, quantum effects in biology became rhetorically bundled with speculative claims, making otherwise orthodox quantum-chemical phenomena less attractive to frame explicitly. At the same time, drug discovery incentives favoured approaches that scaled immediately within established pipelines, while geometry-gated, ultrafast transition mechanisms remained fragmented across disciplines.

In hindsight, this likely delayed the systematic exploitation of such mechanisms by approximately 10–20 years. The impact would have been most pronounced for drug classes in which catalytic geometry, reaction-path control, or transient electronic reorganisation dominate function, including enzyme inhibitors targeting metalloenzymes, redox-active therapeutics, proton-coupled electron transfer systems, covalent and time-dependent inhibitors, allosteric modulators, and drugs acting on highly dynamic or flexible active sites. These classes align closely with the primary targets of the GQR/QGE framework, where curvature-controlled coherence and selection-before-decoherence effects are expected to play a functional role.

This pattern is consistent with earlier historical delays in the acceptance and exploitation of enzyme tunnelling, allostery, protein dynamics, cryo-EM, and mRNA technologies, suggesting structural conservatism rather than malice as the dominant cause.

Dates and links will be updated as peer review progresses.
