Two new manuscripts within the GQR / Quantum Geometry Engine (QGE) programme have been submitted for peer review:

- *The Shield Law: Curvature–Coherence Invariance in a Vibronically-Gated Five-Centre Quantum System* (GQR) — submitted to **F1000Research** for open-access peer review.  
  The decision to submit this work to F1000Research reflects the cross-disciplinary nature of the framework. The geometry-first approach does not align cleanly with the established scope boundaries of many specialist physics journals, which are necessarily selective and risk-aware in their remit. Open peer review was therefore chosen to enable transparent evaluation without constraining the work to a single disciplinary silo.

In addition, the standalone physics manuscript occupying the honorary **GQR18** slot,

- *Transient Directed Transport in a Minimal Time-Gated Quantum System*, is also submitted to a Physics journal for peer review,

is included here as a related contribution. This work is not formally part of the GQR series and represents a self-contained physics study that informed later geometry-first developments. It is referenced for conceptual continuity only and is intended to be evaluated independently, without reliance on the broader GQR programme. A dedicated physics repository is planned for such standalone works.

More broadly, there is no evidence of any conspiracy or intentional suppression of drug discovery. What likely occurred instead was a structural delay. Following widely cited decoherence arguments, quantum effects in biology became rhetorically bundled with speculative claims, making otherwise orthodox quantum-chemical phenomena less attractive to frame explicitly. At the same time, drug discovery incentives favoured approaches that scaled immediately within established pipelines, while geometry-gated, ultrafast transition mechanisms remained fragmented across disciplines.

In hindsight, this likely delayed the systematic exploitation of such mechanisms by approximately 10–20 years. The impact would have been most pronounced for drug classes in which catalytic geometry, reaction-path control, or transient electronic reorganisation dominate function, including enzyme inhibitors targeting metalloenzymes, redox-active therapeutics, proton-coupled electron transfer systems, covalent and time-dependent inhibitors, allosteric modulators, and drugs acting on highly dynamic or flexible active sites. These classes align closely with the primary targets of the GQR/QGE framework, where curvature-controlled coherence and selection-before-decoherence effects are expected to play a functional role.

This pattern is consistent with earlier historical delays in the acceptance and exploitation of enzyme tunnelling, allostery, protein dynamics, cryo-EM, and mRNA technologies, suggesting structural conservatism rather than malice as the dominant cause.

Dates and links will be updated as peer review progresses.
