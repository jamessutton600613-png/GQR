### Purpose

Research programmes mature not only through individual articles, but through **contextual accumulation**: the comparison of independently obtained results that reveal consistent structural patterns across domains.

This section documents **independent convergence**, even where the original works:

- do not reference GQR,  
- are framed conservatively or instrumentally,  
- or fall outside the scope of any single manuscript.  

Inclusion indicates **conceptual relevance**, not endorsement, reinterpretation, or claimed equivalence with GQR. Entries are listed chronologically and the list is living.


### Entanglement as a transient accelerator of outcome selection in quantum dynamics (2025)

Zhao, Zhou & Childs demonstrate that quantum entanglement can *accelerate* quantum simulation algorithms, contrary to the long-standing view that entanglement is primarily an obstacle. By deriving tighter error bounds for product-formula simulations and introducing adaptive protocols that exploit entanglement entropy, they show that highly entangled states can improve algorithmic performance on quantum hardware without requiring long-lived or protected coherence.

**Relevance to GQR:**  
This work independently supports the GQR/QGE position that entanglement need not be treated as a fragile resource that must persist to be operationally relevant. Instead, entanglement can function as a **transient structural feature** that shapes admissible dynamical pathways and fixes outcomes *before* decoherence dominates. In this sense, entanglement appears as a consequence of constrained geometry and coupling topology rather than as a sustained state requiring protection—closely paralleling the GQR interpretation of apparent entanglement in systems such as the oxygen-evolving complex.

### Chiral fermionic transport gated by quantum geometry (2026) ###

Dixit *et al.* report a chiral fermionic valve in which directional electronic transport arises from quantum-geometric properties of the electronic structure rather than from magnetic fields, dissipation, or classical asymmetry. The device exploits Berry curvature and band-geometry effects to achieve non-reciprocal conduction in a solid-state system.

**Relevance to GQR:**  
This work demonstrates that **quantum geometry can gate and bias fermionic transport outcomes** without invoking long-lived coherence or nonstandard quantum effects. The emergence of directionality from geometric structure alone closely parallels the GQR principle that geometry and constraint can pre-select admissible dynamical pathways and outcomes, here realised in a condensed-matter setting.

### Constraint-selected multidimensional nonlinear wave structures (2026)

Dieli *et al.* report the first experimental observation of **lump solitons**—long-predicted multidimensional solutions of integrable nonlinear equations—stabilised by global constraints rather than trajectory tracking.

**Relevance to GQR:**  
Demonstrates how geometry and integrability conditions can pre-select stable outcomes in complex systems, independent of microscopic noise or detailed trajectory control.

### Self-configuring, geometry-driven optical transformations (2026)

Rocha *et al.* demonstrate that complex multi-plane optical transformations can be physically learned and stabilised *in situ*, without offline inverse Hamiltonian design, via hardware-embedded optimisation.

**Relevance to GQR:**  
Supports geometry-first, boundary-condition-driven outcome selection in real, noisy systems, illustrating physical self-configuration without reliance on long-lived coherence.

### Cryogenic self-healing via internal field and energy-landscape minimisation (2026)

Ding *et al.* report autonomous structural and optical self-healing in an organic crystal down to liquid-nitrogen temperatures, driven by dipolar and energy-landscape effects rather than thermal diffusion.

**Relevance to GQR:**  
Undermines kinetics-first assumptions and supports constraint-dominated, non-Arrhenius pathways consistent with geometry-gated transition selection.

### Geometry- and constraint-conditioned electronic phases in moiré systems (2025)

Kumar, Lewandowski & Changlani analyse the origin and stability of **generalised Wigner crystallinity** in triangular moiré superlattices, showing how interaction geometry and frustration govern emergent phases.

**Relevance to GQR:**  
Demonstrates that geometric and coupling structure alone can delimit accessible dynamical outcomes in strongly correlated quantum systems, with phase behaviour conditioned by constraint rather than fine-tuned trajectories.

### Constraint-selected self-assembly of mutually repelling particles under confinement (2025)

de Lima *et al.* show that systems of mutually repelling particles confined in two-dimensional geometries self-organise into stable clusters, shells, and frustrated microstructures despite purely repulsive interactions.

**Relevance to GQR:**  
Demonstrates that geometric confinement and global constraints can pre-select stable configurations in complex systems without detailed trajectory control, paralleling GQR’s constraint-biased outcome selection principle.
