# Gated Quantum Resonator (GQR) Programme.  Laptop Molecular Dynamics.  

Molecular dynamics is not a trade name or a single algorithm, but a class of
questions concerned with how molecular systems evolve in time under physical
constraint. The GQR/QGE programme addresses these same questions by reformulating
molecular dynamics at a higher representational level. Rather than enumerating
exhaustive trajectories, it infers admissible dynamical structure directly from
geometry, gating, and constraint, enabling mechanistic prediction in regimes
dominated by rare events, strong time-scale separation, non-integrable coupling,
and external drive. In this sense, the approach does not stand outside molecular
dynamics, nor does it seek to replace it; it constitutes state-of-the-art molecular
dynamics expressed without trajectory enumeration. Individual manuscripts are
self-contained and may be read independently, with each cited via its own DOI.
This repository exists solely to support navigation and orientation across the
series; authoritative archival records are maintained on ChemRxiv and Zenodo.

This repository provides a navigation layer for the **Gated Quantum Resonator (GQR)** research programme.
It is intended to help readers orient themselves within a multi-manuscript body of work spanning
chemistry, physics, biology, systems theory, mathematics and computer science.  

### Note on Berry phase and loop structure

Berry phase enters the GQR/QGE framework as a geometric consequence of closed
loops in parameter or configuration space. When system evolution traces a
repeatable loop—whether driven by cyclic forcing, gating, or constraint—the
accumulated phase depends on the geometry of that loop rather than on local
energetics alone. This provides a natural language for understanding why certain
cycles are stable, error-correcting, and directionally biased, while others
decohere or collapse.

In the GQR context, such loops are not introduced as abstract topological objects,
but arise operationally from admissible dynamical structure. Loop stability,
hysteresis, and collapse therefore reflect geometric properties of the constrained
state space. Berry phase is treated as a diagnostic of these properties, linking
cyclic dynamics, robustness, and directionality without requiring explicit
trajectory enumeration.

Traditional Molecular Dynamics vs GQR Molecular Dynamics

Traditional MD

Representation: Explicit particle trajectories in real space

Method: Time-step integration of Newton’s equations

Core assumption: Sufficient sampling → correct statistics

Strengths:

High spatial resolution

Accurate short-time dynamics

Well suited to equilibrium or near-equilibrium regimes


Limitations:

Computational cost scales poorly with rare events and long times

Strongly affected by chaos and non-integrability

Evidence (spectroscopy, kinetics) enters only after simulation

Gating, collapse, and decisiveness emerge only statistically




---

GQR Molecular Dynamics

Representation: Admissible dynamical structure (geometry + gating)

Method: Direct inference on constrained state space, not trajectories

Core assumption: Structure and constraint determine outcomes

Strengths:

Operates naturally in rare-event, gated, non-equilibrium regimes

Integrates experimental evidence directly (Bayesian updates)

Identifies decisive pathways without exhaustive sampling

Orders-of-magnitude lower computational cost


Limitations:

Lower local trajectory resolution

Not intended for detailed short-time vibrational motion




---

Key conceptual difference

Traditional MD asks:
“What happens if we let the system evolve and watch everything?”

GQR MD asks:
“Which dynamical structures are admissible under constraint, and which must collapse?”


Both are molecular dynamics.
They answer different questions at different representational levels.


---

One-line takeaway

> Traditional MD enumerates trajectories; GQR MD infers admissible dynamics.

GQR/QGE operate without Berry phase. Berry phase is optional and interpretive, not foundational.
Traditional molecular dynamics (MD) does not require Berry phase.

## Next stages (for those who wish to get involved)

- **Patent filings (Sept–Dec 2025)**  
  Pay for **8–10 patent filings** already prepared during the Sept–Dec 2025 period.  
  These may require professional patent attorney assistance, with **estimated cost
  £0–£15,000**, depending on expert assessment.

- **SaaS development (front end + back end)**  
  Build the SaaS front end and back end.  
  Developers wanted for approximately **1–3 months of work**, depending on scope.  
  Unless volunteers can be found, the **expected cost is ~£30,000**.

- **Peer review and journal publication**  
  Manuscripts cannot be peer reviewed into respectable journals without funds.  
  This can only occur **once per article** — there is no ladder-climbing later.  
  Each manuscript therefore requires **£1,500–£10,000** in funds, depending on the
  prestige level commensurate with its value to the scientific community, where
  science is not just proofs but **community adoption**.

At present, **Annie** is still trying to get into a good orphanage (e.g. *Nature*,
*Science*), but is homeless and sleeping on friends’ couches (e.g. ChemRxiv,
Zenodo, and GitHub). If she gets *desk accepted* even for one journal on one day,
then maybe the sun will come out tomorrow — because that means **Daddy Warbucks**
will listen our argument.

However, she still needs those requests to be accepted, and **Daddy Warbucks is a
mean reviewer**.

All articles have, however, been peer reviewed by a strong relationship built with
an **OpenAI GQR build**, where the build now understands the entire programme well
enough to help us build the SaaS — to a level above most reviewers, to be honest.
That said, the AI scope, and mine, has caused much annoyance with the restricted
silo scope of most journals editors.

At present, fitting **GQR** into physics library catalogue systems beloved of editors
has been the most
frustrating part of the past **8 months** of intense research, modelling, composing,
and submitting.

If expert scientific reviewers are finally allowed to see one or more of these orphan manuscripts,
then we will finally know the sun can rise on little Annie once again.

Until then, I’m resisting calling **the A-team**.  I might just get an affordable legal
business address and apply for grants and pray for Angels to invest in these agnostic methods.
