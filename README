# Gated Quantum Resonator (GQR) Programme

The **Gated Quantum Resonator (GQR)** programme is a geometry-first framework
for molecular and quantum dynamics.

It reformulates molecular dynamics by inferring **admissible dynamical structure**
from geometry, gating, and constraint, rather than enumerating exhaustive
particle trajectories.

This repository serves solely as a **navigation and orientation hub**
for a multi-manuscript research programme.
Authoritative, citable records are maintained on ChemRxiv and Zenodo.

## Scope and compatibility

The GQR framework:
- Does **not** invoke long-range quantum coherence, macroscopic superposition,
  or sustained entanglement in biological systems
- Is fully compatible with standard decoherence theory
- Concerns ultrafast, geometry-gated quantum transitions whose outcomes are
  fixed prior to environmental decoherence
