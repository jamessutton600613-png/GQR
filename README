# Gated Quantum Resonator (GQR) Programme

This repository provides a navigation layer for the **Gated Quantum Resonator (GQR)** research programme.
It is intended to help readers orient themselves within a multi-manuscript body of work spanning
chemistry, physics, biology, and systems theory.

All manuscripts are archived with DOIs on **Zenodo** and, where appropriate, as preprints on **ChemRxiv**.
This page does not host the papers themselves; it explains how to read them.

## How to read this series

**Start here**
- **GQR1** — *The Gated Quantum Resonator: A Bayesian, Circuit–Hamiltonian Framework Complementing MD*  
  Foundational framework paper (ChemRxiv; archival version on Zenodo).

**If you want a mid-series integration**
- **GQR22** — *Geometry, Impulse, and Directed Transport: From Quantum Newton’s Cradles to Geometry-Gated Matter*  
  Progress summary and integrative essay around the GQR22 development point.

**If you want a retrospective interpretation**
- **GQR I–XXI Review** — *Strange Loops and Shield Loops*  
  Conceptual and Gödelian reading of the early GQR sequence.

Readers are not expected to read everything. The programme is modular.

## Core foundations (ChemRxiv)

- **GQR1–GQR11**  
  Primary chemistry-forward preprints establishing the GQR framework, its formalism,
  and early catalytic and biological applications.

## Notes on scope and interpretation

- The GQR framework is **not** a claim of intelligent agency, optimisation, or teleology.
- It is a constraint-driven, open-system formalism intended to complement—not replace—
  established molecular dynamics and quantum-chemical methods.
- Individual manuscripts are self-contained and may be read independently.
