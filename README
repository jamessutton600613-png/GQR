# Gated Quantum Resonator (GQR) Programme.  Laptop Molecular Dynamics.  

Molecular dynamics is not a trade name or a single algorithm, but a class of
questions concerned with how molecular systems evolve in time under physical
constraint. The GQR/QGE programme addresses these same questions by reformulating
molecular dynamics at a higher representational level. Rather than enumerating
exhaustive trajectories, it infers admissible dynamical structure directly from
geometry, gating, and constraint, enabling mechanistic prediction in regimes
dominated by rare events, strong time-scale separation, non-integrable coupling,
and external drive. In this sense, the approach does not stand outside molecular
dynamics, nor does it seek to replace it; it constitutes state-of-the-art molecular
dynamics expressed without trajectory enumeration. Individual manuscripts are
self-contained and may be read independently, with each cited via its own DOI.
This repository exists solely to support navigation and orientation across the
series; authoritative archival records are maintained on ChemRxiv and Zenodo.

This repository provides a navigation layer for the **Gated Quantum Resonator (GQR)** research programme.
It is intended to help readers orient themselves within a multi-manuscript body of work spanning
chemistry, physics, biology, systems theory, mathematics and computer science.  
## Molecular Dynamics and Its Modern Extensions

Students typically encounter molecular dynamics through several related but
distinct methodological families. These differ in representation, scope, and
computational cost.

### Classical Molecular Dynamics (MD)

**Representation**  
Explicit particle trajectories evolving on empirical or semi-empirical force
fields.

**Method**  
Time-step integration of Newton’s equations for nuclei.

**What it is good for**
- Large systems
- Long simulations near equilibrium
- Structural sampling and diffusion

**Limitations**
- No explicit electronic structure
- Rare events and activated processes are difficult to capture


---

### Quantum Mechanics / Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM)

**Representation**  
Classical trajectories with selected regions treated quantum mechanically.

**Method**  
Hybrid embedding of quantum chemistry (often DFT) inside classical MD.

**What it is good for**
- Enzyme active sites
- Chemical reactions in complex environments
- Bridging chemistry and biology

**Limitations**
- High computational cost
- Still trajectory-based
- Sensitive to partitioning and parametrisation


---

### Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD / DFT-MD)

**Representation**  
Classical nuclear trajectories evolving on electronic structure surfaces.

**Method**  
On-the-fly electronic structure calculations (typically DFT).

**What it is good for**
- Small systems
- Short timescales
- Detailed electronic effects

**Limitations**
- Extremely limited time and length scales
- Poor access to rare or gated events


---

## Geometry-Gated Molecular Dynamics (GQR / QGE)

**Representation**  
Admissible dynamical structure defined by geometry, gating, and constraint.

**Method**  
Direct inference on constrained state space, without enumerating trajectories.

**What it is good for**
- Rare-event and gated dynamics
- Strong time-scale separation
- Non-equilibrium and driven systems
- Mechanistic discrimination using experimental evidence

**Limitations**
- Lower local trajectory resolution
- Not intended to replace detailed short-time simulations


---

### Conceptual distinction

Trajectory-based methods ask:  
*“How does the system evolve if we integrate its equations of motion?”*

Geometry-gated methods ask:  
*“Which dynamical structures are admissible under constraint, and which must
collapse?”*

Both are forms of molecular dynamics, but they operate at different
representational levels and are suited to different classes of problems.

### One-line takeaway (for students)

> **Classical MD, QM/MM, and AIMD simulate trajectories; 

<<<GQR/QGE infers dynamics from geometry and constraint.**

## Next stages (for those who wish to get involved)

- **Patent filings (Sept–Dec 2025)**  
  Pay for **8–10 patent filings** already prepared during the Sept–Dec 2025 period.  
  These may require professional patent attorney assistance, with **estimated cost
  £0–£15,000**, depending on expert assessment.

- **SaaS development (front end + back end)**  
  Build the SaaS front end and back end.  
  Developers wanted for approximately **1–3 months of work**, depending on scope.  
  Unless volunteers can be found, the **expected cost is ~£30,000**.

- **Peer review and journal publication**  
  Manuscripts cannot be peer reviewed into respectable journals without funds.  
  This can only occur **once per article** — there is no ladder-climbing later.  
  Each manuscript therefore requires **£1,500–£10,000** in funds, depending on the
  prestige level commensurate with its value to the scientific community, where
  science is not just proofs but **community adoption**.




Below is a clean, structured list of the foundational pillars of GQR, distilled from your recall but grouped by what each contributes to the GQR/QGE worldview (geometry-governed quantum dynamics, constrained coherence, gated pathways). I’ve corrected spellings, resolved overlaps, and added why each belongs — not just who.


---

I. Geometric & Variational Foundations

(Geometry as law, not decoration)

Euclid — axiomatic structure; constraints precede dynamics

Bernhard Riemann — curved manifolds → geometric state space

Leonhard Euler — topology, phase, global invariants

David Hilbert — state spaces, operators, variational principles

William Rowan Hamilton — action, canonical structure, phase flow

Pierre-Simon Laplace — deterministic structure vs uncertainty


GQR role:
Geometry selects admissible quantum paths before dynamics act.


---

II. Quantum Foundations (Non-Classical Causality)

Paul Dirac — operator formalism, constrained dynamics

Erwin Schrödinger — wave evolution on fixed structure

Niels Bohr — complementarity, contextual measurement

Max Born — amplitudes → probabilities

Werner Heisenberg — non-commuting observables

Richard Feynman — sum over histories (key for GQR gating)


GQR role:
Quantum evolution exists, but geometry governs which histories survive.


---

III. Geometric Phase, Interference & Topological Control

(This is the GQR core)

Michael Berry — Berry phase as geometric memory

Hendrik Casimir — boundary-condition physics

Emmy Noether — symmetry → allowed invariants

Lev Landau — stability regimes, order parameters

Ernst Stückelberg — avoided crossings

Function arises from restricted ensembles, not equilibrium averages.

Michael Faraday — field lines as geometry

James Clerk Maxwell — field constraints → wave structure


GQR role:
Fields impose curvature and confinement on quantum motion.


---

VI. Information, Computation & Governance

Alan Turing — rule-based admissibility

Claude Shannon — capacity, noise (implicit in GQR)

Thomas Bayes — updating under constraints


GQR role:
Quantum systems compute by geometry, not logic gates.


---

VII. Chemistry, Biology & Evolutionary Selection

(Why proteins beat silicon)

Linus Pauling — orbital geometry, resonance

Charles Darwin — selection over viable pathways

Ron Naaman — geometry-spin coupling in biology


GQR role:
Evolution discovers geometric quantum control long before engineers do.


---

VIII. Relativity, Cosmology & Limits

Albert Einstein — geometry = physics

Nathan Rosen — connectivity via geometry

Roger Penrose — global structure, nonlocal constraints

Stephen Hawking — information, boundaries, horizons


GQR role:
