### Purpose

Research programmes mature not only through individual articles, but through **contextual accumulation**: the comparison of independently obtained results that reveal consistent structural patterns across domains.

This section documents **independent convergence**, even where the original works:

- do not reference GQR,  
- are framed conservatively or instrumentally,  
- or fall outside the scope of any single manuscript.  

Inclusion indicates **conceptual relevance**, not endorsement, reinterpretation, or claimed equivalence with GQR. Entries are listed chronologically and the list is living.

### Converging developments in ordering, identity, and collective transport (post-submission context)

Recent work on **nonlocality arising from particle indistinguishability** has shown that identical fermions and bosons can exhibit experimentally detectable nonlocal correlations without engineered interactions or entanglement, purely as a consequence of symmetry and identity constraints (Błasiak & Markiewicz, *npj Quantum Information*, 2025). Although this work is framed in terms of Bell nonlocality rather than transport, it reinforces a central structural insight shared with the AOI–QGE programme: namely, that **ordering and indistinguishability can have physical consequences independent of microscopic forcing**. This perspective is conceptually aligned with the ordering-first arguments developed in GQR-36 and Paper X (GQR-40), where non-commuting accessibility alone is shown to generate irreversible, measurable outcomes. The Polish results arrived after submission of those works and should be understood as **convergent rather than overlapping**, operating in a complementary domain (nonlocality versus transport).

A second line of recent experimental progress concerns **ultra-low-noise collective current states** in quasi-one-dimensional charge-density-wave nanowires (Ghosh *et al.*, *Nature Communications*, 2026). These experiments report a suppression of current noise and the emergence of unusually quiet collective transport regimes, suggesting that **constraint-dominated pathways can stabilise macroscopic current behaviour** beyond expectations from independent quasiparticles. While the authors do not invoke ordering invariants or accessibility frameworks, the observations resonate strongly with the transport-level predictions of AOI–QGE developed in GQR-37–39 and extended in Paper C (GQR-41), where boundary mediation and cumulative ordering produce robust transport signatures without invoking hydrodynamic closure. As with the nonlocality work above, these experimental results post-date the present AOI–QGE submissions and should be read as **evidence that the broader field is moving toward structural and ordering-based explanations**, rather than as competing theories.

Recent Fabry–Pérot interferometry experiments in bilayer graphene demonstrate that quantum transport and interference in fractional quantum Hall systems are **protocol-dependent**. Measured flux periodicities, dominant interfering quasiparticle charges, and statistical phase contributions depend on how magnetic field, density, and gating are sequenced over time, rather than being determined solely by instantaneous parameters or topological classification. By tuning trajectories in magnetic-field–density space, the experiments reveal cumulative effects associated with the controlled introduction of bulk quasiparticles, producing history-dependent interference patterns that persist even when short-time fluctuations obscure individual phase slips.

Within the **AOI–QGE** perspective, these observations are naturally interpreted as consequences of **ordered accessibility**. Geometry, boundaries, and gating define which transport pathways are available, while the *temporal ordering* of those accessibility windows determines which pathways accumulate influence over time. In this view, conventional transport laws and familiar interference periodicities correspond to regimes in which accessibility updates effectively commute (ordering suppressed), whereas deviations signal the emergence of an **ordering-sensitive memory channel**.

Importantly, AOI–QGE does not replace established topological, quasiparticle, or hydrodynamic descriptions. Instead, it provides a **structural overlay** compatible with standard quantum mechanics and electrodynamics, while exposing phenomena that are invisible to time-averaged or purely static analyses. The Nature results therefore represent a clear point of **field convergence**: condensed-matter experiment, topological quantum matter, and geometry-first transport theory independently indicating that **temporal ordering is a physically operative degree of freedom**. In short, geometry sets capacity, while ordering writes history.

### Entanglement as a transient accelerator of outcome selection in quantum dynamics (2025)

Zhao, Zhou & Childs demonstrate that quantum entanglement can *accelerate* quantum simulation algorithms, contrary to the long-standing view that entanglement is primarily an obstacle. By deriving tighter error bounds for product-formula simulations and introducing adaptive protocols that exploit entanglement entropy, they show that highly entangled states can improve algorithmic performance on quantum hardware without requiring long-lived or protected coherence.

**Relevance to GQR:**  
This work independently supports the GQR/QGE position that entanglement need not be treated as a fragile resource that must persist to be operationally relevant. Instead, entanglement can function as a **transient structural feature** that shapes admissible dynamical pathways and fixes outcomes *before* decoherence dominates. In this sense, entanglement appears as a consequence of constrained geometry and coupling topology rather than as a sustained state requiring protection—closely paralleling the GQR interpretation of apparent entanglement in systems such as the oxygen-evolving complex.

### Chiral fermionic transport gated by quantum geometry (2026) ###

Dixit *et al.* report a chiral fermionic valve in which directional electronic transport arises from quantum-geometric properties of the electronic structure rather than from magnetic fields, dissipation, or classical asymmetry. The device exploits Berry curvature and band-geometry effects to achieve non-reciprocal conduction in a solid-state system.

**Relevance to GQR:**  
This work demonstrates that **quantum geometry can gate and bias fermionic transport outcomes** without invoking long-lived coherence or nonstandard quantum effects. The emergence of directionality from geometric structure alone closely parallels the GQR principle that geometry and constraint can pre-select admissible dynamical pathways and outcomes, here realised in a condensed-matter setting.
