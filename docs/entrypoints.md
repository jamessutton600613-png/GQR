# How to read the GQR programme

This repository supports a **live, multi-manuscript research programme**.
Readers are **not expected to read everything**, nor to follow a fixed order.

Each GQR manuscript is self-contained and independently citable.
This page provides orientation and suggested entry points depending on interest.

## If you want a single overview

Start here:

- **Geometry, Impulse, and Directed Transport**  
  (GQR progress summary essay around the GQR22 phase)  
  Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18131362

This essay provides a mid-series integration of the framework, vocabulary,
and design philosophy without requiring prior reading.

## If you are a molecular modeller or computational chemist

Recommended starting points:

- **GQR I** – Framework and formalism  
  ChemRxiv: https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-m7wxn-v5

- **GQR VIII / IX** – Photosystem II and enzyme-scale applications  
  ChemRxiv: https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-tsbd2  
  ChemRxiv: https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-k7pld

These papers establish how geometry-gated dynamics complements
classical MD, QM/MM, and ab initio approaches in catalytic systems.

## If you are interested in inverse design, transport, or materials

Recommended starting points:

- **GQR XXVI** – Quantum Geometry Engine for multi-centre systems  
  Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18134191

- **GQR XXVII / XXVIII** – Directional coherence and noise-robust transport  
  Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18131691  
  Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18132052

These works are most relevant for inverse design, constrained inference,
and geometry-conditioned material behaviour.
