# Programme Index — GQR / QGE / GC-arc / Math

This page is the canonical front page for the programme.
Entries are ordered **chronologically by conceptual dependency**, not by upload date.

## Significance codes
- **CORE** — load-bearing papers defining invariants or formal structure  
- **FORK** — domain extensions or applications of the core framework  
- **INCIDENTAL** — contextual, exploratory, reflective, or precursor works  

For **CORE** papers, a *Direct Precursor* is listed where a single prior read is required.
